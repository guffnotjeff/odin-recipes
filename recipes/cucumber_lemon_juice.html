  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Cucumber lemon is a refreshing beverage made by combining freshly squeezed lemon
    juice with cucumber slices. It's a hydrating and cooling drink, perfect for hot
    days. The tanginess of the lemon pairs well with the mild flaor of cucumber,
    creating a delightful balance. You can add a touch of sweetness with honey or
    sugar if desired.
